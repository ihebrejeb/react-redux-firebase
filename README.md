This app is built using React, Redux and Firebase.
It is my first project implementing these technologies together.

This app uses:
-Firebase authentication for signing up and logging in.
-Firebase cloud functions to create a real time notification every time a user joins or a user creates a project.

You can find the demo for this app here:
